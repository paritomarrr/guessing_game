# RUST
 
 Rust is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency

 ## multi-paradigm -> code ko alag alag ways mein likhne ki technique
 we want to use the same code but hume diff features chahiye toh uske liye hum multi-paradigm technique use krte h

 ## general - purpose -> alag alag purpose ke liye hum rust ko use krskte h
 mtlb hum software bhi bana rahe h rust se as well as game bhi bana rhe h 

 ## Rust is system programmable
 They are used to build software and software platforms. They can be used to build OS, Game engines, compilers, etc

 System and Application programmng lang faces 2 major problems
 - difficult to write secure code
 - difficult to write multi-threaded code


 ## why rust?
 Rust focuses on
 - speed
 - safety
 - concurrency
